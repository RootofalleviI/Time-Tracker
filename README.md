# Time-Tracker

I wrote this just to track how I spend my time. Have fun.


## Commands

- `woc start <task-name>`: Start tracking a task. 
- `woc stop -m <message>`: Stop tracking a task. Write data to a file.
- `woc clean -f`: Delete INPUT_FILE
- `woc hard-clean -f`: Delete INPUT_FILE and OUTPUT_FILE
